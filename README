This is a low tide calendar. No other tide calendar exists like this one.

The objective is to put in one place:

- Low tides
- The reasons why they occur
- The events that occur at the same time

This is being made for the Yay Area, in the Western United States.

Why? 
The tide comes twice a day, most places. 
On the East coast, those two high tides and two low tides are equal (semidiurnal). 
On the Best coast, they are unequal (diurnal inequality of a mixed tide regime).

Why? 
The Atlantic moves like a standing wave, because of the shape of the giant bathtub open at one end (bathymetry). 
]The Pacific has more fluctuation, because it's shaped like a toilet bowl open at two ends.

How exactly? 
The West Coast's tides are affected by the wiggling of the moon (declination). 
When the moon is over the equator, the two tides are equal on the West Coast. 
When the moon has wiggled far to the South or North (of the ecliptic), the two tides are very unequal.

When does this happen? 
About every 13.6 days (1/2 draconitic month). 
The West Coast minus tides only occur in this brief window of time.

What time of day do the minus tides happen? 
In the summer they happen at dawn. 
In the winter they happen at night. 
In the spring they come during the day. 
In the fall they come at the witching hour. 
This is because of the sun.

What about the moon? 
Every two weeks the minus tides get earlier and earlier. 
Every day the minus tides arrive 45 minutes later. 
Then there's a pause (moon over equator at 0° declination). 
Then they come again, much earlier than they started out 13.6 days before.

Why is this so horrifically complex? 
Because the minus tide calendar for the West Coast hasn't existed... Until now.
