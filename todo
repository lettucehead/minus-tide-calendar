Minus Tides
Part 1: Hours
- Select rows where tide passes below or above a threshold, like from >0.3 to <=0.3 or <=0.3 to >0.3
- Plot the times when the tide is below this threshold
- Make a table of these times
- Rows are hours, so this is a table of hours.

Part 2: Days (Sessions)
- Select days where there are minus tides.
- Minus tides intersecting midnight should include both days.
- Plot and tabulate.

Part 3: Weeks (Cycles)
- Select days with NO minus tides
- Make these days the "weekends"
- Plot and tab per cycle w the lowest tide of the day + duration of sub-threshold minus tide being the two variables of interest

Part 3: Fortnights
Part 4: Seasons

these will have to wait for...

Moon Movements
Part 1: Lunation/Synodic Month/Full-New Cycle
- Get the new, quarter (50%), and full moon dates
Part 2: Perigee/Anomalistic Month/Close-Far Cycle
- Get the dates of perigee and apogee
Part 3: Equator/Draconitic Month/Declinational Cycle
- Get the dates of greatest, least, and zero declination

Sun Movements
- This one should be pretty self-explanatory:
- Get the distance and the declination

Astrology
- Use Astrodienst's ephemeris for Western and Sidereal positions of the sun and moon.

Stargazing
- Use JPL's ephemeris for Earth
- Look up Fall to Spring minus tide session times in a table of star positions to see what's visible where, when

Extra credit: Use Bernoulli's equation to calculate the volume of the tub and time how long it takes to refill, and see if this is variable, and see what it varies with
